    <h1><div id=myDIV>Modification in design of Hartnell Governors and improved its performance</div></h1>
    <p><b>Aim:</b>To find the required geometerical design modification for Hartnell Governors to decrease its sensitivity and hence to increase in stability during performance</p>
    <p><b>Problem Satement:</b>We have our basic design of Hartnell Governor. In that design we usually take the angle between arm as zero and the ball lies on the tip of bell crank arm. So while modifying its design we're going to vary one of these keeping the other value constant. And we'll check how the performance is varying with change in these two parameters. </p>
