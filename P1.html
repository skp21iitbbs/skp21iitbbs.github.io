    <h1><div id=myDIV>Snake and Ladder Game</div></h1>
    <p><b>Aim:</b>Create a Snake and Ladders game from C language</p>
    <p><b>Problem Satement:</b>You will have a 10x10 places over the board. It's a multiplayer game </p>
    <h2>Loading bar</h2>
      <p>It's just a basic Loading bar made using the windows.h Sleep command using color 0A (green) text colour. The main fuctions calls it at the very beginning of our game code for the gaming look.</p>
    <h2>Playgame</h2>
    <p>This is main part of our code. Where the whole game's algorithm lies in. Player access this function fron the main function, and then based on the number of players playing, it forms the loop in which game runs untill someone reaches to the end.</p>
      <p>For various conditions, like geting the six for the very first time to begin the game or having a ladder or getting cut by a snake.</p>
      <p>This game has a simple 2d matrix representation, which prints the player number to the position where the player was at last time, and also prints all the way it is, for graphic gamming analysis. It also has the finishing condition, which prevents the pawn to not get lost after getting more values than the 100th element of the array.</p>
      <h2>Main Function</h2>
      <p>It is the CPU of our whole code. It access all other function, as the user desires, and returns the ouput after every function gets executed.</p>
      <p>For my game, this main function also works as the main menu function, where either you can play the game, or you can get the tutorials on how to play it.</p>
